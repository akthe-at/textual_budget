# textual_budget
A textual based TUI app for my wife to use when tracking our budget/examining bank transactions.

Photos to come.

Application is designed for CSVs of transactions from the bank to be uploaded to the TUI app, stored in a Sqlite db, and processed from there. The processing of transactions allows for my wife to flag transactions that look strange or that she wants to follow-up with myself on. Additionally, she can change the category from the category automatically assigned by the bank.
